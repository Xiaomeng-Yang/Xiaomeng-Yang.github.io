I am a final-year Computer Science M.S. student at Information engineering institute, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences working with [Prof. Yu Zhou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~yuzhou). My research interests lies in multi-modal learning. And the ultimate goal of my research is to enable machines perceive, understand, interact with, and learn from the 3D world.

Before that, I completed my undergraduate study from ZJU-UIUC Institute at International Campus of Zhejiang University located in Haining, Zhejiang, China. As a student of ZJU-UIUC Institute dual-degree program, I got a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering with Honors from ECE Department of UIUC and Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from Zhejiang University.

**Iâ€™m actively looking for a Ph.D. position starting from Fall 2024.** You can contact me at xiaomeng.rachel@gmail.com or yangxiaomeng@iie.ac.cn.

**Welcome,**

I am a first-year PhD student at Northeastern University, co-advised by [Prof. Yanzhi Wang](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/wang-yanzhi/) and [Prof. Xuan Zhang](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/zhang-xuan-silvia/). My research focuses on multimodal AI, generative models, and their applications to scientific challenges.

Previously, I completed my master's degree at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I worked with [Prof. Yu Zhou](https://intimelab.github.io/) on visual text analysis and understanding. I graduated with dual bachelor degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Zhejiang University, majoring in Computer Engineering.

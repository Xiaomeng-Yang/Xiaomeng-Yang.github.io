**Welcome,**

I am a final-year Computer Science master student at Information Engineering Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, working with [Prof. Yu Zhou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~yuzhou). I am interested in exploring the multimodal AI. And the ultimate goal of my research is to enable machines perceive, understand, interact with the wonderful 3D world.

Before that, I was very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liangjing Yang](http://person.zju.edu.cn/en/ylj) and [Prof. Volodymyr Kindratenko](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/kindrtnk) at the ZJU-UIUC Institute. I graduated with dual bachelor degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Zhejiang University, majoring in Computer Engineering.

*Iâ€™m actively looking for a Ph.D. position starting from Fall 2024 :D*

Reseach Experience

* <p style="text-align:left;">**Linguistic Information Enhanced Scene Text Recognition**<span style="float:right;">Jun. 2022 â€“ Present</span></p>
  * UCAS | Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Yu Zhou
  * Explored the relationship between the visual features and text information in scene text recognition
  * Proposed a framework for autoregressive decoding using masked, permuted implicit context learning and length supervision. Enhanced model robustness against length prediction errors through perturbation training. Our approach outperformed on challenging benchmarks. This work resulted in a top-tier conference submission.
  * Explored non-autoregressive decoding in scene text recognition as image-based conditional text generation. Utilized discrete diffusion with a small transformer decoder and easy-first decoding for enhanced bidirectional context awareness. The manuscript is completed for submission to a top-tier journal.

* Involving OCR into the Flow of TextVQA
  * Developed two accurate TextVQA models by integrating OCR into the process.
  * In the first scheme, designed a reading modification module for adaptive answer selection based on context. Visually enhanced text embedding and semantically oriented object embedding were used to enhance the feature representations. This approach, more robust to the OCR errors, led to a paper accepted at ACM MM 2021.
  * In the second scheme, devised an efficient end-to-end network integrating text reading and reasoning, optimized by the downstream VQA signal. The approach outperformed existing alternatives in accuracy and robustness. This research led to a publication in Pattern Recognition 2023.
